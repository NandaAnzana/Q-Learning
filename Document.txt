Q-learning !

Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn a policy telling an agent what action to take under what circumstances.  So i build this agent using OOP (Object Oriented Programming) pardigm and try to solve Taxi problem from Openai gym. 
There are four designated locations in the grid world indicated by R(ed), G(reen), Y(ellow), and B(lue). When the episode starts, the taxi starts off at a random square and the passenger is at a random location. The taxi drives to the passenger's location, picks up the passenger, drives to the passenger's destination (another one of the four specified locations), and then drops off the passenger. Once the passenger is dropped off, the episode ends.
 - blue: passenger
 - magenta: destination
 - yellow: empty taxi
 - green: full taxi
 - other letters (R, G, Y and B): locations for passengers and destinations
After 100.000 episodes of training, you can see the result. 
Shoutout to Kelas Terbuka Youtube channel for refresh my skill OOP in python and TheComputerScientist for clear explanation of q-learning!
